# ChineseCharacters100
Development version of Chinese Character Learning App.
Much thanks to: https://github.com/skishore/makemeahanzi
(1)Their code provides some guidlines on implementing a Chinese Character writing app
(2) It provides +5000 SVGs with characters, individual strokes etc. (The idea would be impossible without these)

This app is a combination of objectives. 
(1)One is to master/develop project management skills within the software world. 
(2)The other is the creation of a passive income earner on Android and App Stores.

The application should:
(1)Teach users the top x number of Simplified Chinese characters
(2)Teach users the correct stroke order
(3)Allow users to practice writing characters and have their efforts assessed
(4)Evaluate their learning of the characters in quizzes
(5)Share their results with friends via social media
